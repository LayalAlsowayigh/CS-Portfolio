🚔 Car Dealership System

This is a Java project for practicing object-oriented programming.  
I created a Car class and two subclasses NewCar and UsedCar to model different types of cars.  

The project shows how inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract methods work together in Java.

👩‍💻 How to Run
1. Open the folder in VS Code or any Java IDE.  
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac Dealership.java
