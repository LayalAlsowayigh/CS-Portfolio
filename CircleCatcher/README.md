# Circle Catcher Game

This is a small JavaFX game where circles appear randomly on the screen and the player clicks them to “catch” them.  
It helped me learn how to use GUI programming and event handling.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have JavaFX installed.  
2. Compile and run with Maven:
   mvn clean install
   mvn javafx:run
